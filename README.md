# Improving Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Information Bottleneck 


## Overview
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We propose a novel, information-theoretic principle termed "minimal sufficient coarsened graph," specifically designed for the generation of coarsened graphs. This principle theoretically guides a model to generate informative yet compressed coarsened graphs to enhance the model's expressiveness while minimizing information loss.

- We incorporate node degree information and adopt a dynamic generation mechanism to control information flow, thereby enhancing the sufficiency of the coarsened graph. On the other hand, to achieve minimality in the coarsened graph, we design a noise injection method that selectively introduces dynamic noise into the coarsened graph, filtering out irrelevant substructures. Ultimately, we propose a novel end-to-end framework called Graph Pooling Information Bottleneck to learn predictive yet compressive representations at graph level. 

- We theoretically prove that imposing constraints on the coarsened graph generated by the final pooling layer is equivalent to imposing constraints on the coarsened graph generated by all pooling layers. By imposing the constraints on a single coarsened graph as opposed to all, our model effectively reduces the number of parameters and mitigates the risk of overfitting.
## Research Overview
he overall architecture of Graph Pooling Information Bottleneck (GPIB) consists of several interconnected modules. In the graph coarsening module, we amalgamate feature and edge information to generate the clustering assignment matrix, which effectively mitigates the semantic bias originating from individual data sources. To further enhance this process, we incorporate the principle of the "minimal sufficient coarsened graph." This principle aids in imposing constraints on the final coarsened graph produced by the pooling layer, thereby facilitating the creation of a high-quality graph representation. Moreover, our architecture features a noise injection module, where intentional noise is introduced into the coarsened graph representation. This particular strategy aims to diminish the correlation between the coarsened graph and the original graph, subsequently enhancing the robustness and overall representation of the coarsened graph.
